> I chose to make my game music themed quizes becuase music encompases so many things. The possibilites of quizes that can be made are endless. Music came as a natural topic for me since I was formally a music teacher. I love all things music and it is something I interact with daily. Music Quiz Games is a game filled with multiple kinds of music quizes. Users can put their knowledge to the test. Each quiz will contain 10 questions.
